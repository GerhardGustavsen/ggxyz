I've long wondred how i shuld document this project. In the summer of 2021 I bought a van. I then converted this van to a camper, and then procided to live fulltime in it for over halv a year. I have decided to splitt the project into 2 articles. One about the practical process of converting a van to a camper and another article about the vanlife lifestyle and my thoughts on it. This will be the article describing the build prosess. The other vanlife article can be found [here](./vanlife).

## Planning
Ive long had the dream of building a van to live in full time. In the spring of 2021, covid was raging and I wanted to have a big new project to spend my time on. There was few activities so, I thought I might as well realize my vanlife dream. However as most people are aware of, its not so simple to just start a huge project. Everything feels scary and nothing is thought out. I had made some rough economic calculations, but knew that the varriance was large. My statagy to get starting and compleating a huge project like this is as follows.

1. Start to think about it. The projcet shuld be well thought out and you shuld be comterble with the idea. Also the idea of failing the project. 
2. Start to talk about it. Make it obvius for the people around you that this is somthing you beleve is posible, and that you are going to do it. This is a sneaky stratagy becouse now you got your ego wrapped upp in the project. I hate going back on what ive said, so this is a good motivator for me. 
3. Spend a lot of money. Ok, this last step seems a biut irresposible. But I like spening a considerable about of mony on big projects that im afraid of not compleating. This is to enshure that I dont give upp so easaly. On this vanbuild project, spening the mnoney was easy. Buy a van!
 
This whole process was driven by a really concrete working plan. Never thnk about the compleate result, and only focus on the next step. This is a well known stratagy, that i feel is essential for projects of this scope.

So Annyways, i bought a van... A renault master III. The car was big, and the biggest car i had driven by a long shot. I flew to Bergen and bought it there. Pro tip: dont fly to buy a car, as it makes it a bit harder to not buy the car when actually seeing the car. ðŸ˜…

## Woodworking

The next problem was building it. I had only 2 months in the summer untill the next semster would start. It was crutial that i finished the van within this timeframe, as after the summer my contract for my room would run out and I would be without a home. I therefore started working like a madman. I wanted to start with the woodworking as it seemed the most concrete, and It seemed the easyest. Boi was I wrong. 

The woodworking proved to be a lot harder and more time consuming than i had originally tought. I have worked a fairt bit with wood before, but never at this scale, and it took an imence amount of time to get annything done. I had bought the car with some isolation and woodpanneling already installed, but this works soon showed to be really badly done and i had to tear it all down. I then started on the bed, ad it would take upp a lot of the space. It tunes out that build a bed that does not creek in a car that moves, is pretty hard.

After the bed frame, i build the walls and cabinets. I isolated the walls with armaflex, and glava. Pro tip: dont use glava. I used a lot of handtools as i did not have acsess to anny workshop. 

After building the frames for most of the car, i went climbing. I wanted to test how it was living in the car, so I went to vingsandfor a week. There I slept in the car and spent my time outside in the sun. It was terribly nice to take a break, but I soon started to stress a lot about finishing the car.

I Then went to Halden and continued the woodworking, then I went back to Trondheim to finsih the panneling. I beleve most of the 2 monts were spent woodworking. pro tip: dont make drawers in a car. It tunes out that cars move, and they bend, so the draws get stuck. bad idea.

## Electrisity

So on to somthing more intresing, but a hell of a lot more expensive. Power!

- One 12volts "House" battery of 200AH.
- The car dynamo
