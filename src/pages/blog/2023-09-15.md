Decided on conigguring neovim instead of joing the party at home. Went to [OV](https://omegav.no/), and ended upp testing a tesla coil. 

Thoughts on [neovim](https://neovim.io/): 
- Awsome fast
- Awsome configurable
- possible to spend a liftime configuring and never getting the time to actually code.
