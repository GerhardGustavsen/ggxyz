## Background
In the beginning of 2017 I switched school to RUD vgs to study mechanics and metals. I switched school half a year later than most other peers so therefore laged one whole semester behind when starting. At RUD I learnt a great deal of things, and sadly little of it is documented in a good way. I figured i shuld post somthing from that time here as it is a period that means a lot to me. The project I beleve is the most intresting to post is my study of the 2 cycle engine. 

## Project
We were tasked to take apart a 2 cycle engine, document the process and have critical parts messured. Then we were tasked to build the motor back together, have it run, and wright a papaer on how we dismantled and build togher the engine. This was espeshely challenging considering I had never taken apart a motor before, and bolth me and my partner Zuriel had joind the school one semester laiter that our peers. I remeber that we were the only ones to finish the task on time and also that we had a working enigine after the assebling. Therefore I am quite proud of the yunger me that wrote this and find the project quite cool. Below is a link to the pdf.
