Loving is dying.

🖤🖤🖤

One can see the texture of other people by they way they interfere with ourself. 

It then becomes apparent how finite a person is. We are truly nothing more than half smart apes. 

Loving a creature like that is a terrible curse. One cannot no longer pretend to be above it all. 

One comes face to face with the finality of life. The finality of man. 

God would never fall in love with an ape, yet still he does. This is the horrible paradox. 

Onces one acsepts this love, one gives upp the infinet and becomes human. 

This is the most extreme of deaths. This fall from infinety is to mutch to handle, and it cannot be endjured alone. 

🖤🖤🖤

Perhaps together.
