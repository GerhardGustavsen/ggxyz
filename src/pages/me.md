### Hi!
Hi, and welcome to my small corner of the internett.
My name is Gerhard Gustavsen. I am a software developer currently based in Trondheim. I work with [arealize](https://www.arealize.ai/) to create a better way for architects to draw buildings. I also love to rock climbing and try to get out as often as possible.

Thanks for stopping by!
